# Wireshark

Wireshark is a network packet sniffer that lets you inspect the contents of network packets for hundreds of different protocol types. In CTFs, sometimes you’ll be given or discover `.pcapng` files (packet capture next generation dump file) in forensics challenges which Wireshark can open. Wireshark basically lets you capture and analyse the network activity happening on the machine that’s running it.

### Filters

Wireshark shows a very large amount of data, so in CTFs, the first functionalities you want to take advantage of are the **filters**. The filtering is incredibly handy and advanced as Wireshark provides their own ‘display filter language’ that lets you have very granular control about what you see in the output.

For example, you can just show HTTP requests by specifying ‘http’ in the filter box.

You can take this further and filter down to just the HTTP requests that resulted in a `200 OK` status.

The *display filter language* lets you make more advanced conditional expressions like the following:

### Inspection

When selecting a packet, you’ll see a panel with dropdowns containing header information at each layer of the network protocol stack and also the corresponding hexdump.

You’ll also be able to inspect the contents of the payload.
