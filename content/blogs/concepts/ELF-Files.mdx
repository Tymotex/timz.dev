ELF (**E**xecutable and **l**inkable **f**ormat) format is the standard file format for *executables*, *shared libraries*, *object files* and *core dumps* on most Linux systems. Files in the ELF format are very commonly provided in CTF challenges, particularly for reverse engineering and forensics challenges, as plenty of tools and techniques exist for deriving insight from them!

ELF files are the typical output of compilers and linkers.

ELF files consist of an **ELF header** a **program header** table (listing ≥ 0 *segments*), a **section header** table (listing ≥ 0 *sections*) and the actual machine code. This guide will explore each of these, including what segments and sections are and how they’re used.

Also, here is an [incredibly detailed dissection of ELF files](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/ELF_Executable_and_Linkable_Format_diagram_by_Ange_Albertini.png/1920px-ELF_Executable_and_Linkable_Format_diagram_by_Ange_Albertini.png) as a useful supplement to learning about them!

## ELF Header

The header is crucial for ensuring that the file is correctly interpreted by the OS when it’s executed, or when it is passed to the linker if it’s an object file.

The `readelf` command lets you inspect details about ELF files, such as the ELF header. For example, let’s consider the following C program, `simple.c` .

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compiling with `gcc -o simple simple.c` produces an ELF executable, `simple` . We can then use `readelf -h simple` to read the ELF header and gain some insight 

```c
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              DYN (Shared object file)
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x1060
  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          16848 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         13
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         36
  Section header string table index: 35
```

From this output, you can know a few things about 

It’s targeting a 64-bit architecture, little endian, 

As an aside, I found it interesting that the simple binary was of type `DYN` rather than `EXEC` . Here’s a [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34519521/why-does-gcc-create-a-shared-object-instead-of-an-executable-binary-according-to) that gives a bit more context about why this happens to the output files of `gcc` .

Note that in general, we can tell what format a file is meant to be by looking at the first few bytes, often called ‘magic bytes’. To identify an ELF file, we expect the first 4 bytes to be `0x7F, 0x45, 0x4C, 0x46` , where those last 3 bytes spell out ELF (check the ASCII table [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html)).

* 0x45 == E
* 0x4C == L
* 0x46 == F

Running `file simple` would let you very quickly confirm the file format based on the magic bytes:

```bash
$ file simple
simple: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d9da8c1d5941118dd1869a0d32eb8a0ad01865d2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

## ELF Program Header (Segments)

The program header table shows the ***segments*** used at *run-time*, which basically tell the OS *how* to use the ELF file contents to create the virtual address space for the process to execute. In other words, the program header table contains the information that the system uses to know how to create the [*process image*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41865240/whats-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-process-image).

You can use `readelf --segments simple` to print out the ELF program header.

## ELF Section Header (Sections)

The section header table lets you locate all of the file’s *sections* which contain important data about how to link files.

You can use `readelf --sections simple` to print out the ELF program header.

## ELF Segments and Sections

One important thing to understand about the difference between *segments* and *sections* is that their ‘relevance’ depends on how the ELF file is being used — whether for execution or for linking. In the case of execution, the segments contain all the info and the sections are *simply ignored*. In the case of linking, the sections are used and the segments are ignored. 

Segments and sections both identify a group of bytes in the ELF file, and there can definitely be overlap. Any byte can be a part of 0 or 1 sections and they can simultaneously also be part of 0 or 1 segments.
