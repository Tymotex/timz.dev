Cross site request forgery (CSRF, often pronounced ‘sea surf’) is an attack that takes advantage of you being logged in at other websites. In CSRF attacks, the attacker crafts a link to a site you trust that, when clicked, will launch a GET request that performs a malicious action — which works because you’re logged in and therefore the server thinks you’re legitimately trying to perform that action. For example, if you’re logged into a banking app which exposes an HTTP GET endpoint that performs some money transfer, then the attacker might craft a link that looks like [ `https://bank-app.com/transfer?to=attacker_id&amount=100` ](https://bank-app.com/transfer?to=attacker_id&amount=100). When the attacker gets you to click on this link, your browser makes a GET request to bank-app.com’s servers, instructing them that you’re making a money transfer of $100 to the attacker!

Attackers might put this GET request link in an `<a>` element or `<img>` element on their own innocuous-looking website or  they might send it through a link in an email, for example.

```html
<a href="[https://bank-app.com/transfer?to=attacker_id&amount=100](https://bank-app.com/transfer?to=attacker_id&amount=100)">Click me!</a>
```

Nowadays, REST API conventions are widespread and discourage programmers from exposing a GET request that does any kind of state change. A common misconception however is that you can only launch CSRF attacks against HTTP GET endpoints. To launch a CSRF attack that makes a POST request instead, you’d have to make a form element with hidden inputs and an innocuous looking submit button to lure the victim into clicking it:

```html
<form action="http://bank-app.com/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker_id" />
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="100" />
    <input type="submit" value="Innocent button!" />
</form>
```

Alternatively, you could make the form hidden and not even require the user to click anything, but only to load the page by attaching an `onload` event handler that submits the form in the background automatically.

```html
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="http://bank-app.com/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker_id" />
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="100" />
    <input type="submit" value="Innocent button!" />
</form>
```

You can launch a CSRF attack off of a *stored XSS* attack, which we call a **stored CSRF attack**. For example, when you discover a stored XSS vulnerability on a site that lets you post comments, then you could insert an `<img>` element that 

**Defending Against CSRF:**

As the backend engineer implementing an API, ensure that you do not expose a GET endpoint that does any kind of state change. You can do this by following REST conventions for designing an API. As mentioned however, CSRF attacks can be launched with other HTTP verbs like POST, PUT, etc. so designing the API according to REST conventions is far from a foolproof defense against CSRF attacks.

One of the best defence strategies that’ll give web developers confidence that their servers are safe from carrying out CSRF attack requests is to use an *anti-csrf tokens.* The idea is that you get the server to generate a *one-time code* (sometimes called a *nonce*) every time the form loads or once per user session (a little less secure). This token could just be a random string of characters — it doesn’t particularly matter what it is as it is near-impossible for an attacker to guess. The web server then checks that the incoming request has precisely that one-time code it gave in the past and refuses to execute any request where the one-time code doesn’t match.
