### VMWare Workstation Kali Linux Setup

This is very brief list of steps to perform to install VMWare Workstation Player and spin up a virtual machine running Kali Linux, for an Ubuntu host machine. These steps were are verified to be working for Ubuntu 20.04 as of Mar 2, 2022.

*Important note:* please ensure you enable ‘CPU virtualisation’ in BIOS/UEFI otherwise VMWare might fail by crashing on attempting to power on the virtual machine. Here's a [quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK0DOfdLCa8&ab_channel=Sysadmin102) on how to do this for ASUS motherboards.

1. Download the bundle file [VMWare Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/au/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) for Linux.
2. Install the downloaded bundle file by running `chmod u+x <path_to_bundle_file>` followed by `sudo <path_to_bundle_file>`.
3. Download the [VMWare Kali Linux bundle file](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines).
4. Extract the downloaded bundle file (this takes at least a minute to complete on my machine).
5. Start up VMWare Workstation and follow the wizard to reach this welcome menu. Click on ‘Open a Virtual Machine’ and select the path to the .vmx file in the extracted folder of step 4. Note that we’re not actually creating a new Virtual Machine since we downloaded a pre-built Kali Linux VM.

6. The VM should be ready to launch. Hit ‘Power On’.

7. Enter the username ‘kali’ and password ‘kali’ to log in. These credentials are ‘baked into’ the pre-built VM in the bundle file that was downloaded in step 3.
8. Done!
