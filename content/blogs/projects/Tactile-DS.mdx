Tactile DS is a web-based terminal interface that allows you to experiment with a suite of interactive
data structures and algorithms written in C.

The <a href="https://github.com/Tymotex/DataStructures">backend repo</a> contains a collection of documented implementations of classic data structures and algorithms.

This was a personal project that I developed as a resource for the COMP2521 classes I was managing during my time working as a casual academic at UNSW.

See all the details about the project and codebase <a href="https://github.com/Tymotex/DataStructures">here</a>.
