Konflux is a realtime timetabling tool, built with React, Next.js, TypeScript and Firebase,
aimed at minimise the familiar frustrations involved in picking a time that suits everyone for a group event.
It aims to provide a lightweight user experience similar to [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/),
but with fewer of the shortcomings of that solution.

The first iteration seeks to implement everything that When2Meet provides while
presenting a better user interface and leaving an extensible system for more 
quality-of-life features to be added such as timetable caching, weather data
for physical venues and notification distribution.

A demonstration of how it works:
