[Transperler](https://transperler.timz.dev) is a regex-based transpiler for mapping POSIX shell scripts to equivalent Perl 5 scripts. It supports the translation of most control structures and some commonly used builtin shell commands to Perl. It aims to preserve the comments and indentation of the original input file. 

**Why would you want to convert Shell scripts to Perl scripts?** 
The most common use case for this is when you have written a 'one-off' Bash script that
has accidentally evolved into something more complex as requirements have
grown. Converting Shell scripts to Perl scripts lets you leverage a language that offers a 
richer native API for text processing, efficient data structures, libraries, etc. It's also 
OS-independent, whereas Shell scripts are much more challenging to make portable.
There are more reasons why Perl, as well as other scripting languages like Python or Ruby, should be
preferred over UNIX Shell such as security, maintainability, testability... see this [Perlmonks discussion](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=668481).

This project also features a PWA built with Vue, Nuxt.js, Tailwind and TypeScript, as well as an API server written in Go and Gin that wraps around the Perl 5 transpiler and the [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) Shell script static analyser.

The transpiler client features a minimal Shell code editor and live preview for
the Perl 5 output. Whenever the user has finished typing, the client sends a 
series of requests to the API server to check the validity of the Shell script,
and proceeding with invoking the Perl 5 transpiler if it is valid.

The architecture for the project is pretty simple and follows a traditional
client/server setup. If this project were required to scale up to serve more concurrent users, it would be
better to extract out the static shell analyser and transpiler into separate
microservices so they can scaled out independently.
