Hack is a 16-bit computer I built with hardware simulators, based on the [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture). Jack is a
simple programming language modeled after Java, with a compiler
I wrote in C++. I built the Hack computer and the Jack compiler with
implementation suggestions from 'The Elements of Computing Systems' by Nisan and Schocken,
which is basically the book version of [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
