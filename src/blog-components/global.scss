// This file contains all the styles for blog components.

// Note: why aren't we using SCSS modules for blog components? Unfortunately,
//       there is no SCSS module support for `mdx-bundler`. Using CSS-in-JS
//       solutions is problematic as well. Eg. `styled-components` will cause
//       a nasty warning around hook violations because the styled components
//       are 'created' in `getMDXComponent`.
