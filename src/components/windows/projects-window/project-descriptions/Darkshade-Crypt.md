A 2D dungeon crawler game, written from scratch in Java. This object oriented programming project involved implementing
several design patterns such as the strategy pattern, composite pattern, observer pattern and template pattern from scratch. Developing this game involved implementing dynamic pathfinding algorithms for the enemy AI, spritesheet animations, unit testing with JUnit 5 and building a GUI with JavaFX.
