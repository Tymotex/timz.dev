Blitz Breach is an extended version of an old classic, Arkanoid. The player controls a paddle
and must maneouver a ball to smash all the presented blocks without missing a return. Built
with C# on the Unity game engine.

Extensions on classic Arkanoid:

-   Block durability levels: darker blocks require multiple collisions to be destroyed
-   Special blocks: some blocks yield a large amount of points when destroyed, others give you an additional life when destroyed
-   Double paddles: levels in zone 2 feature a paddle attached to both the top and bottom of the screen, requiring the player to take greater care but also allow them greater control over the ball
