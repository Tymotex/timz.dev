A Python web scraper, built with the Selenium browser automation library. The user is prompted for a category of quotes to scrape and the amount. The script then starts a chrome process, navigates to brainyquotes.com, then scrapes all relevant HTML elements, saving the quotes to a plaintext document and downloading associated images. It automatically scrolls down the webpage to collect further quotes.
