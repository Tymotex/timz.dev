Hi! I'm Tim, a final year computer science student at the University of New
South Wales (UNSW).
I love working on software projects, especially when they're related to
frontend/backend engineering and low-level infrastructure.
I have also taught the data structures and algorithms course,
<a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/COMP2521?year=2021">COMP2521</a>, at UNSW for 3 semesters.
Computer science is an absolute blast for me and I enjoy sharing knowledge with others ðŸ¤“.
