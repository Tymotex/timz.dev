Hi! I'm Tim, a 3rd year software engineering student at UNSW.
I love programming and working on software projects, especially full-stack engineering and data science projects. 
I have also taught the data structures and algorithms course, <a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/COMP2521?year=2021">COMP2521</a>, at UNSW for 3 semesters. Computer science is an absolute blast for me and I love sharing my knowledge with other people ðŸ¤“.
