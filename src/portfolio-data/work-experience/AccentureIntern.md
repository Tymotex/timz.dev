Developing an educational platform that tailors lessons for young children with ASD for the _Autism Awareness_ charity organisation.

-   Built a prototype of the product, achieving 1st place in Accenture's 2021 hackathon
    out of 37 teams, and later pitched the project to Accenture to acquire funding for continued development.
-   Implemented a lesson builder interface for developing reusable therapy sessions,
    reducing work that previously would take hours to just minutes.
-   Implemented a content management GraphQL API using Node.js with TypeScript, Express and MongoDB.
-   Formed core requirements and designed a concept for a neural network backing
    the platform's learning recommendation engine.
