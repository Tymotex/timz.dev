This game was built from scratch with C# on the\nUnity game engine.\n\nThe player uses WASD to maneuvre a spaceship and SPACE to fire lasers at the encroaching alien\ninvaders. Astral Assault is split into difficulty zones with tougher alien ship types, more asteroids\nand more stray enemy lasers. Each zone consists of roughly 10 levels. The player passes a level\nwhen all enemies are cleared and passes the zone when all levels are passed.\n\nThere are several powerups that are embedded inside asteroids which can be consumed after they are destroyed\nby either taking enough damage or by colliding with a ship.\n\n-   Companion powerup: two smaller companion ships spawn nearby to assist the player\n-   Ammunition powerup: the player's fires two additional projectiles, increasing their damage output\n-   Shield powerup: an EM field spawns around the player that can protect them from incoming projectiles\n-   Life powerup: the player gains an additional life\n","id":"60b200cf-db8d-5d55-a232-eabdbe72f77a","fields":{"slug":"Astral-Assault"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Astral-Assault"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
